		Cross-subject and cross-study comparability of preclinical imaging data, whole-brain imaging data in particular,
		is contingent on the quality of registration to a standard reference space.
		Current methods for neuroimaging rely on full image processing, with high varying intensities outside the brain
		region of interest that interfere with registration. Applying the processing to a masked image improves the
		quality of the latter. Here we present a deep learning enabled framework for segmentation of brain tissue in
		functional and structural MR images that when included in a small animal brain imaging workflow significantly
		improves the quality of the latter.
